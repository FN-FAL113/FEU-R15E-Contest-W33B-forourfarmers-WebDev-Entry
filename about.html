                            We started out as COVID-19 donation drive and immediate response initiative to help farmers
                            and fisherfolks who were greatly affected by the pandemic. With the clear vision
                            of wanting to help and uplift local farmers and fisherfolks, we transitioned
                            from a simple “donation drive” into a youth-led non-stock non-profit organization.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Realizing that even before the pandemic, farmers are already the poorest of the poor in the country,
                            our team is committed in helping and assisting farmers and fisherfolks through sustainable and
                            inclusive projects.

                            <i>We strongly believe that the people who till the land and feed us should never go hungry.</i>

                            We believe that we can achieve bigger things through working hand-in-hand with partner individuals, organizations and businesses. With collaborative partnerships, we were able to extend our help to more farmers all over the Philippines.
